# MARP - What is this folder?

Most of this project has markdowns that are converted to slides using [MARP](https://marp.app/). This folder contains the CSS files that are used to style the slides.

## How to use it

We use the vscode extension to convert the markdowns to slides. You can find it [here](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode). There you will find the instructions to install it and use the themes.
